PROGRAMMING
Create a file of .cpp extension 
write ur desired code in that file
after that open terminal and use "g++ 'file name'" command to compile the program
the compiling will be completed and a new file (a.exe) will be created
to view the output of compiled program use ".\a.exe" command.

HOW TO WRITE A CODE
  #include<> is used to call any existed function of C++ to use in the present code
  run the "main() {}"function
  we have to return0 for the program to run correctly by using "int" before the main function
  inside the main function at last we have to give "return0;"
  standard template library - std:: 
  after taking std we can acces its inside functuions also it taken by "using namespace std" before main function
  then use the "cout<<"anything you want";
  Thats it you have done a program 
  then follow the compiling steps to bring output
#include<bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout<<"HELLO IM SWANITEJ"<<endl;
    return 0;
}
