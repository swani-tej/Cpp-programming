Types of operators : 

1. Arithematic operator : +,-,/,*
2. Logical operators :||,&&,! ....
3. Relational operators : <> , >=, <=..
4. Bitwise: | &
5. conditional operators(Ternary):    ?:
6. Increment/Decrement operators : ++ --
7. Assingment operators : =

Operator precedence.

1. Arithematic operator : 

a. Addition +
b. substraction -
c. multiplication *
d. Division /
e. Modulo %(gives remainder)


2. Relational operators :

a. "is equal to" ==
b. "not equal to" !=
c. greater than >
d. less than <
e. greater than or equal to >=
f. less than of equal to <=

The result of relational operator is always a boolean value . (True/false)(1/0)


3. Logical operator : 

 a. Logical OR      ||
 b. Logical AND     &&
 c. Logical NOT     !
