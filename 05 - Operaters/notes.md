Types of operators : 

1. Arithematic operator : +,-,/,*
2. Logical operators :||,&&,! ....
3. Relational operators : <> , >=, <=..
4. Bitwise: | &
5. conditional operators(Ternary):    ?:
6. Increment/Decrement operators : ++ --
7. Assingment operators : =

Operator precedence.
Bit manupulation

1. Arithematic operator : 

a. Addition +
b. substraction -
c. multiplication *
d. Division /
e. Modulo %(gives remainder)


2. Relational operators :

a. "is equal to" ==
b. "not equal to" !=
c. greater than >
d. less than <
e. greater than or equal to >=
f. less than of equal to <=

The result of relational operator is always a boolean value . (True/false)(1/0)


3. Logical operator : 

 a. Logical OR      ||      ConditionA || ConditionB   
 b. Logical AND     &&      ConditionA && ConditionB
 c. Logical NOT     !       !ConditionA


The result of Logical operators is always a boolean value . (True/false)(1/0)
The logical operators are applied on condition.


4. Bitwise operator :

a. Bitwise OR       |
b. Bitwise AND      &
c. Bitwise XOR      ^
d. 1's compliment   ~
e. left shift       <<
f. right shift      >>


Only int and char datatypes can be used.


Assignment Operator: 

 =

Example : a = 10

+=
-=
*=
/=
%=


Ternary Operator : 

Also known as conditional operator.

denoted as ?:

example:

string is EligibleToVote = (age>=18)? "Is Eligible To vote" : "Is Not Eligible To Vote"
